# Agent instructions

akc.io is an event management product, developed as a pnpm monorepo with two apps.

- `apps/backend` — NestJS + Prisma + Postgres. Auth: BetterAuth (mounted at `/api/auth/*`, treat as a black box). API docs: Swagger at `/api/docs`.
- `apps/frontend` — React + Vite + TanStack Router/Query, Tailwind + shadcn/ui, `ky` + `zod` API client. Feature folders under `src/features/`.

Organize backend features into controllers, DTOs, services, domain models and repositories. Organize frontend features into API schemas, query options, hooks and components. Keep shared infrastructure outside feature folders.

**Before writing or changing any UI, read [`DESIGN.md`](DESIGN.md).** It is the akc.io design system: tokens, components and how to add them (#79).

## Commands

- `pnpm dev` — everything: env files, Postgres (Docker), migrate, run the seed entry point, both dev servers
- `pnpm check-all` — lint + type-check + tests + build (same as CI)
- `pnpm backend test` / `pnpm frontend test:ci` — unit tests
- `pnpm backend prisma:migrations:run` — create/apply migrations after schema changes

## Product identity and compatibility

Use `akc.io` as the product name in UI, emails, API metadata and documentation; use `akcio` where a technical identifier cannot contain a dot. This repository implements akc.io and is not a reusable starter.

Do not retain or introduce backward compatibility for previous product names, starter behavior or superseded internal contracts. Remove obsolete aliases, shims, fallback branches and transitional code when replacing them; update all affected callers and configuration to the current contract. Do not rename external resources without verifying their actual identity.

## Conventions

Deliberately sparse — this file grows as the team learns what it expects from generated code. Add rules here when you find yourself repeating the same review feedback.

### User stories are owned by the PM

User stories are read-only for agents by default. Only David, acting as PM, may explicitly authorize an agent to create, edit, delete, regenerate, import or synchronize user stories. A request to implement a story, fix code, update documentation or complete a feature is not authorization to change the story.

This rule covers local stories in `docs/user-stories/`, their requirements, acceptance criteria, scope, priorities and approval metadata, the source feature workbook, and corresponding GitHub issue titles and bodies. Do not run `docs/user-stories/import.py --execute` without explicit PM authorization, because it writes story content to GitHub.

If implementation reveals a gap or conflict, report it to the PM and propose a change in your response; leave the story unchanged. When the PM explicitly requests story changes, make only the authorized changes. Reading stories and reporting implementation progress remain allowed.

### UI controls come from the kit

Need a control that isn't in `src/components/ui/`? Add it with `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add <name>` — don't hand-roll one in a feature folder, even where a native input would do the job. One accessibility implementation to reason about beats a per-control judgement call.

Use semantic tokens from `apps/frontend/src/styles/global.css` and follow the project requirements in `DESIGN.md`.

### The app is already running

Assume the dev servers are up. If something is listening on the app's ports, that is this application: use it. Don't start a second instance, don't restart it, don't run `pnpm dev`.

Don't reach for the browser to check your own work. Tests and type-checks are the evidence; open the running app when asked to, not on your own initiative.

### Delivery gates

Every implementation PR links its issues with `Closes #N`. Request requirements
review from `darebakdavca`. Leave the issue In Progress when opening a PR.
Requirements approval for every linked current PR commit must move the issue to
Ready for Code Review before Copilot runs. Agent review must then pass before
the Ready for Testing handoff. New commits or revoked requirements approval
return the issue to In Progress. `MatejKrones` approves QA after testing
the handoff commit. PRs authored by `darebakdavca` are exempt from requirements
review and may enter code review immediately; Matej still performs QA after the
handoff. On Matej’s PRs, David covers both requirements and QA. The substitute approves once for requirements and again
after the testing handoff for QA. All stages and CI must pass before merging. New code requires
fresh reviews and QA. See [the delivery workflow](docs/delivery-workflow.md).
Never manufacture passing gate evidence or bypass merge protection.
